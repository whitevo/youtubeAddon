Describe your organization's work as it relates to YouTube *
I am a simple youtube user who hired a freelancer to create an addon to make managing my youtube subscriptions a bit better.

Please list all your API Client(s) *
YouTube Data API v3

Please list all the project numbers used for each of your API Client(s) *
youtube-addon-242514

Where can we find each API Client(s)? *
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-helper/, https://github.com/whitevo/youtubeAddon

If there is a log-in required to access the API client, please provide a demo account and instructions on how to access the API Client

Explain how your API Client is used by your users *
I log in.
Then I selected the channels where I would like like to add the video to my watch later.
Then I select specific videos what I actually want to add.
Finally, press confirm.
And that's it.

Please provide more detail on how many users have authenticated to your API Client, and how authenticated data is used in or by the API Client
I think only I am authenticated right now.
Authentication is used to get faster access to the client youtube information and then I don't have to have my own login method, but its simply 1 click.

Which API Client are you requesting a quota increase for? *
Youtube addon 1

What API project number are you requesting increased quota for? *
242514

Justification for requesting additional quota? *
Right now with 10k quotes, I can add around ~40-140 vides
Weekly I have ~200 videos to add and I use this addon weekly.
To avoid errors I alone need 50k quotes.
However, if somebody else starts using it, then I would need double the amount.
And if he has even more videos then it will get even grazier.
But for now, I just think ahead for about ~10 ppl

Explain in detail how you use YouTube API Services today *
I log in.
Then I selected the channels where I would like like to add the video to my watch later.
Then I select specific videos what I actually want to add.
Finally, I press the button to confirm.
And that's it.

What functionality would your API client be lacking without more quota? *
I will start getting errors midway of adding videos because all the previous video sorting and capturing uses most of it.
Also, I could not use that for more users than one.
Because right now I can't even sort 20% of my videos with single go (If I forget using this addon for 3 weeks)

What potential workarounds would you use to compensate for less quota? (ex. decreased feature set, estimations, smaller sampling) *
I have talked about this with a freelancer and he could cache some videos, but the request would still have to be made, so he sais he cant optimize it even further.
Simply need more quotes.
